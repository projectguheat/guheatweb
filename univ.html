                <h3>University of the Philippines-Mindanao</h3>
                <p>The University of the Philippines Mindanao (also referred to as UPMin or UP Mindanao) is a public research university, serving as the sixth constituent unit of the University of the Philippines System. UP Mindanao is the only constituent university of the UP System that was created through legislative action. Republic Act 7889 formally created UP Mindanao on February 20, 1995, and was later formally recognized as an independent constituent university by the Board of Regents of the UP System on March 23, 1995. Its main focus of education is Mindanao studies through an affirmative action program in the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao to attract Muslims and Lumad students, aside from the marginalized and deserving students. The university was first named University of the Philippines in Mindanao to declare the arrival of the state university in Mindanao after a long period of waiting by eager alumni and students. This was later replaced to its present name due to the request of the UP System for formalities’ sake.

                    The university offers nine undergraduate degree programs and five graduate program heavily inclined in research through its two colleges and one school; the university is the one of its kind in the Philippines to have a discipline in Agribusiness Economics (ABE), and is one of the three worldwide to have such a degree program.
                    
                    As of 2017, the Philippines' Commission on Higher Education (CHED) awarded a National Center of Development (COD) to UPMin in Information Technology and in Biology education (College of Science and Mathematics). Currently the university is developing itself to become a Center of Culture and Languages, engaging in activities enriching the Filipino and ethnic languages and Mindanao through literature and translation; the university is also a co-founder and active member of the Davao Colleges and Universities Network (DACUN) in the field of cultural integration and development.
                    
                    The university also aims to become the best science university in Southern Philippines with the UP Mindanao Science and Technology Park Consortium; the university’s long term plan is to transform UPMin to a “green university town”, the only one of its kind in the UP system and in the Philippines.[3][4]</p>

Many of the leaders of the Visayas graduated from UPV or its predecessor institutions. As of 2007, the Commission on Higher Education of the Philippines awarded four National Centers of Excellence and Development to UPV including Fisheries (UPV-Miagao), Marine Science (UPV-Miagao), and Biology (UPV-Miagao).</p>
